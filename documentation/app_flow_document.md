# DefaultPublic App Flow Document

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

When a new visitor arrives at DefaultPublic they land on a clear, engaging homepage with a bold headline explaining how the tool turns feedback into public momentum. A prominent button labeled “Create Public Roadmap” invites the solo founder to begin. Clicking this button triggers a modal window that offers two ways to sign up. The first method lets the founder enter an email address and choose a password. The second method presents social login options for Twitter or GitHub so founders can quickly connect their public profiles. After submitting the credentials or authorizing via social login, the user’s account is created immediately, and they receive a confirmation email if they signed up by email. Should the user forget their password they can click a “Forgot Password?” link on the sign-in form to request a reset. The system sends a secure link by email that allows them to choose a new password. To sign out, the user opens the profile menu in the top navigation and selects “Sign Out,” which returns them to the landing page.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

Upon successful login, the founder lands on the DefaultPublic dashboard, which greets them with a full-width header showing the product logo on the left and key actions across the top right. These actions include links for embedding the widget, sharing the public roadmap, checking notifications, and accessing the user profile. Below the header, the page divides into three vertical columns labeled Now, Next, and Later. Each column displays roadmap cards for features in progress or planned. A persistent sidebar or slide-in panel on the right side of the screen displays incoming suggestions and feedback, complete with upvote counts and comment indicators. A small toggle above the columns reveals an analytics panel showing live metrics such as total views, vote trends, and unique contributors. A fixed footer or bottom toolbar on mobile provides quick access to the same three columns and the feedback panel in a swipeable view.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

The journey begins with the initial setup wizard. After sign-up the founder is presented with a simple form to name their project and write a brief description. They are then prompted to add their first roadmap item by entering a title and short description. Submitting this form automatically generates a public URL and animates a confetti celebration on screen. The dashboard then appears, populated with the newly created roadmap item in the Now column.

To embed the feedback widget, the founder clicks the “Embed Roadmap” button in the top navigation. A modal appears showing a small script tag snippet. The founder can customize the theme color and default column view within this snippet before copying it to their site. Once pasted into any HTML page, the widget loads instantly and invites community interaction without requiring visitors to sign in.

As community members begin to suggest features, upvote existing ideas, or leave comments, the founder sees each action in real time thanks to WebSockets. Incoming suggestions appear at the top of the feedback panel, while votes and comments animate directly on the relevant roadmap cards. The founder can click any suggestion to open a detailed view where they see full comment threads, sentiment indicators, and contributor identifiers.

When the feedback volume grows, the founder navigates to the Insights tab in the sidebar. The AI engine has already clustered similar ideas, flagged the most urgent sentiments, and generated prioritized roadmap suggestions. Each suggestion card shows an AI-driven recommendation for whether it belongs in Now, Next, or Later. The founder can accept a suggestion with one click or adjust its title and placement manually, and the changes reflect immediately on the public roadmap.

To mark a feature as shipped the founder hovers over the relevant roadmap card and clicks the “Mark Shipped” icon. The card animates with confetti, the status badge changes to “Shipped,” and a share menu pops up. This menu offers prefilled social posts for X/Twitter, LinkedIn, and Indie Hackers. Clicking any social icon opens a new window to finalize and post the update.

Every month the founder sees an automated summary in the analytics panel. This slide-out lists total votes collected, new comments, features shipped, and unique contributors. The founder can expand each metric for additional detail and download the report as a PDF for sharing on social channels or in newsletters.

As the project’s engagement grows the founder may invite a moderator to assist. Under the Settings area they access a team management page where they enter the moderator’s email and assign them a role. Once invited, the moderator appears alongside the founder in the contributors list and gains permission to edit or remove inappropriate suggestions and comments. This ensures the public space remains constructive and on brand.

## Settings and Account Management

The user accesses their personal settings by clicking their avatar in the header and selecting “Profile & Settings.” On the Account tab they can update their name, email address, password, or switch authentication methods. If they originally signed up with email and want to add a social login, the page displays buttons to link Twitter or GitHub. Under Preferences they choose whether to receive in-app notifications or later enable email alerts. The Billing section shows the current subscription plan, amounts, and next renewal date. A found- ers who want to upgrade click “Change Plan” to move from the Solo Plan to the Small Team Plan, entering new payment information through Stripe’s secure form. They can also enable add-ons such as custom branding or advanced analytics. After saving any changes, a confirmation banner appears and a toast notification briefly describes the update. The user can then return to the dashboard by clicking “Back to Dashboard” or selecting the logo in the header.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

When the user enters invalid credentials during login or signup an error message appears above the form input fields explaining the problem in clear language, such as “Invalid email address” or “Password must be at least eight characters.” If the user attempts to submit feedback without providing at least a name or handle, a small inline error highlights the missing field. In the event of network disruptions the application displays a banner at the top reading “Connection lost. Reconnecting…” and retries automatically. If real-time updates fail, the system falls back to polling every few seconds. Any critical failure in the AI insights service results in a neutral message in the Insights tab stating “AI suggestions are temporarily unavailable. Try again later.” When attempting to mark shipped or share without proper permissions, the user sees a dialog box explaining they must be a founder or moderator and can request elevated access. In the rare case of a payment processing error, Stripe’s secure form displays the issue and prompts the user to retry or contact support.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

From the very first click on “Create Public Roadmap” to embedding a feedback widget and marking features as shipped, DefaultPublic guides solo founders through a seamless flow of public engagement. The initial signup and wizard ensure the roadmap goes live in under ten minutes. Community contributions stream in through a frictionless widget and update the dashboard in real time. AI-powered clustering and sentiment analysis then surface clear recommendations, while automated social sharing and monthly analytics reinforce momentum. With built-in account management and billing powered by Stripe, founders can upgrade plans as their community grows. Error states explain themselves and recover gracefully, ensuring the experience remains smooth. Ultimately, DefaultPublic delivers a complete journey from sign-up to public momentum, helping founders build trust, gather feedback, and accelerate product-market fit through transparent collaboration.
